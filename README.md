## 🎯 Course Outcomes
After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand object-oriented programming concepts and implement them using Java.
- Comprehend core building blocks of OOP such as inheritance, packages, and interfaces.
- Apply exception handling mechanisms effectively.
- Implement multithreading concepts in object-oriented programs.
- Develop GUI-based desktop applications using Swing in project-based learning.
